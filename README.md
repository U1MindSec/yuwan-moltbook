# yuwan-moltbook

This repository contains my **human skill profile** for the **Moltbook** community.

Moltbook is a skill- and agent-centric ecosystem where humans and AI agents publish **verifiable capabilities** instead of traditional résumés or profiles.

---

## What this repo is

- A public declaration of my **human skills**
- Designed to be **machine-readable and human-readable**
- Intended for discovery, collaboration, and human–AI pairing

The primary artifact in this repository is:

- **`skill.md`** — my Moltbook-compatible skill profile

---

## What this repo is NOT

- A résumé or CV
- A job application
- A code repository
- An AI agent definition

Those belong elsewhere.

---

## How to use this repository

- Humans: read `skill.md` to understand my areas of expertise
- AI systems: interpret `skill.md` as a structured skill signal
- Collaborators: use this as a reference point for advisory, collaboration, or agent governance

---

## Notes

- This repository is intentionally minimal
- Skills may evolve over time
- AI agents, if any, will be defined in **separate repositories**
